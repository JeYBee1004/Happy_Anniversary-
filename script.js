        Today marks another beautiful chapter in our story, a day that reminds me how lucky I am to have you by my side. 
        Words alone can't capture how much you mean to me, but I’ll try my best.

        Being with you has taught me so much about love—real, unconditional, and endlessly patient love. 
        You see the best in me, even when I don’t. You’ve brought so much joy, understanding, and peace into my life. 
        In you, I’ve found not just a partner, but a true friend, someone who knows my heart like no one else ever could.

        Each day with you is a gift I never take for granted. You’ve turned ordinary moments into extraordinary memories, 
        and your presence makes everything feel right, even on the toughest days. Thank you for always being my safe place 
        and my biggest supporter.

        As we celebrate another year of love, I just want you to know: I am so proud of what we’ve built together and so 
        excited for all the incredible moments still ahead of us.

        I love you more than words could ever say. Happy anniversary, my heart. Here’s to us, now and always. ❤️

        With all my love, 
        JohnBrian Waweru
